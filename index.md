## About Me

Solving complex perception problems in robotics and autonomous driving is my passion. Over the years, I've had the privilege of contributing to groundbreaking work at leading companies like Cruise, Toyota Research Institute, Waymo, and Google Robotics. From hands-on development of SLAM and tracking algorithms to leading teams responsible for critical systems like traffic light detection and multi-object understanding, my journey has focused on leveraging machine learning to make autonomous systems safer and more reliable.

## Education

I hold Ph.D. and Master's degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. My doctoral research, advised by Professors Seth Teller and Nicholas Roy, focused on the intersection of robotics and AI, specifically on enabling machines to learn semantic environmental maps from natural language. Prior to that I did my undergraduate studies at University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka.
